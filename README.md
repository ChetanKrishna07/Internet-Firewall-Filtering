# Internet-Firewall-Filtering
Firewalls are the most important network security device in any secure network. Firewalls filter packets based on the packetâ€™s data and properties and take action. In this project, we propose an ensembled Artificial Neural Network Model for filtering web packets. The Data Set used for this project is Internet Firewall Dataset. The Proposed model was run on 10 subsets of the dataset and performed with an accuracy of 99.8%. This is a slight increase in accuracy compared to a normal Neural Network trained on the whole data, which gave an accuracy of 96.4%.
